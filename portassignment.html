<center><button class="btn btn-outline-primary">About Me</button></center>
<center><p><b>A passionate Developer <br>Who Loves to Code</b></p></center>

<p class="">Lifelong passions for technology, design, and people guide my professional experience in roles where I’ve connected users with their ideal technology and automotive solutions. My interest in UX design spans from childhood, eagerly awaiting new software for my PC, Palm, and video game devices dissecting which features changed and which remained. When loved ones need help navigating software, they often call on me to guide them through it.  It’s been my pleasure to create engaging user experiences throughout my career.

At Microsoft I led demonstration classes helping users get the most from new and updated SaaS products improving brand image and client satisfaction. At Chevrolet I built value in auto sales and leases with one-on-one guidance of the newly integrated MyLink infotainment systems. At Rocket Fiber I designed and supported home network solutions while embodying the people-first philosophy of an ISP startup.

I'm an empathetic UX & UI Designer with a background in the demonstration, integration, and sales of consumer and business technology. With a lifelong passion for design & UX, interpersonal experience with end-users, and mastery in UI design/prototyping tools, I add value to roles in which I create engaging user experiences.
